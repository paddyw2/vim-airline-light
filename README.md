# Custom status line and buffer tabs

A <code>.vimrc</code> lightweight alternative to the Airline or similar plugins. To use, copy and paste the <code>airline-light.vim</code> contents to the end of your <code>.vimrc</code>, and, to recreate the screenshot, change your theme to gruvbox. Alternatively, you can choose to only copy the buffer tab code, or just the status line code - they are independent.

### References

I used two online references heavily in creating this, and they are referenced in the <code>airline-light.vim</code> file.

### Screenshot

To customize, simply read through the code and change colors, functions etc. The default colours are based on the Airline Base16 theme, and the vim theme used is gruvbox (not included in this script).

### Motivation

* To learn more about vimscript and how vim customizations work
* To create a faster alternative to the awesome Airline plugin
